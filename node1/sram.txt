So I've taken a look at what we have to do about the SRAM.

If you take a look at the ATmega162 datasheet
There is something called MCUCR which is the MCU control register
There is also something called EMCUCR which is the Extended MCU Control Register

And the SFIOR

Take a look at page 25 there is somee schematics with the Latch and SRAM

Writing SRE to one enables the External Memory Interface

So to initiate the EMCUCR

	MCUCR |= (1 << SRE);

Also check External memory addressing page 30-31

	#define OFFSET 0x1000

	void XRAM(void){
		unsigned char *SRAMaddress = (unsigned char *) (OFFSET+1);
	};


I've added this to the sram.c file.

What needs to be done:
	-Check out in lab if the UART works properly now.
	-Wiring the ATmega162 to the latch, SRAM and GAL IC
	-Complete the VHDL code for the GAL IC
	-Fix the wiring and do SRAM test afterwards
	-(check out the low-pass filter on the ALE signal, schematic STK501)
